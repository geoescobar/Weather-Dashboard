## Homework 6 - Weather Dashboard
 In this activity we were tasked with pulling specific data from an API and displaying it in an easy to read manner for the user. 

 # My Process

 * On this assignment I broke it down into 3 parts

 # Part 1:

* Creating the nav bar and making sure that they are linked to the rest of the page and have a functional search tab & history dropdown. 

* For the layout I used mostly bootstrap elements. 

# Part 2:

* Create the main dashboard - to display the current city and have additional information displaying weather conditions. 


# Part 3: 

* Attaching the next 5 days date & weather details. 

* This was the hardest part of the project for me. Making sure to link the data accordingly and making sure to display within the correct column.
